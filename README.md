## ðŸŽ¯ Tips for Success
1. **Stay Modular:** Build each system independently and integrate them gradually.
2. **Start Small:** Focus on building a minimal, functional engine before adding advanced features.
3. **Use Open Source for Reference:** Study engines like [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) or [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/).
4. **Be Consistent:** Even a few hours a week adds up over time!
